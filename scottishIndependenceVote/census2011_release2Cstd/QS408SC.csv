"(1) Occupancy rating provides a measure of whether a household's accommodation is overcrowded or under-occupied.  It compares the actual number of rooms available to a household and a notional measure of the number of rooms required given the number, age and relationships of the people in the household.  An occupancy rating of -1 implies that a household has one fewer room than required for the people living there, whereas +1 implies that they have one more room than the standard requirement."
