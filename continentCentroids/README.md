continentCentroids
====

Prompted by a probably [throwaway remark by Simon Redfern on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sim0nRedfern/status/516785006107426816), I set out to calculate the centre-of-mass centroid of Eurasia (and other continent centroids come with it); all workings courtesy of StackOverflow and GIS Stack Exchange contributors (referenced in Rscript)

- `continentCentroids.R`: Rscript to generate data frame and plot of continent centroids, thanks to 'rworldmap' and 'rgeos' packages;
- `eurasia-centroid_zoomN.png`: Google Maps screenshots.
